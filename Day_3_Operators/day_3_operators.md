# Booleans
A boolean data type represents either values: *True* or *False*. 

# Operators
## Assigment Operators
They are used to assign values to variables. For example, equals (**=**) in math shows that 2 values are equal however, in Python means that we are storing a value in a certain variable. Refer to table below:

## Arithmetic Operators
- Addition(**+**): a + b
- Subtraction(**-**): a - b
- Multiplication(**\***): a * b
- Division(**/**): a / b
- Modulus(**%**): a % b
- Floor division(**//**): a // b
- Exponentiation(**\*\***): a ** b

![Arithmetic operators](/images/arithmetic_operators.png "Arithmetic Operators")
```py
# Declaring the variable at the top first

a = 3 # a is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type
b = 2 # b is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type

# Arithmetic operations and assigning the result to a variable
total = a + b
diff = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b
remainder = a % b
floor_division = a // b
exponential = a ** b

# I should have used sum instead of total but sum is a built-in function - try to avoid overriding built-in functions
print(total) # if you do not label your print with some string, you never know where the result is coming from
print('a + b = ', total)
print('a - b = ', diff)
print('a * b = ', product)
print('a / b = ', division)
print('a % b = ', remainder)
print('a // b = ', floor_division)
print('a ** b = ', exponentiation)
```
## Comparison Operators
We check if a value is either greater or less or equal to other value. Please, refer to the image below:

![Comparison operators](/images/comparison_operators.png "Comparison Operators")
```py
print(3 > 2)     # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 >= 2)    # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 < 2)     # False,  because 3 is greater than 2
print(2 < 3)     # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(2 <= 3)    # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(3 == 2)    # False, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(3 != 2)    # True, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(len('mango') == len('avocado'))  # False
print(len('mango') != len('avocado'))  # True
print(len('mango') < len('avocado'))   # True
print(len('milk') != len('meat'))      # False
print(len('milk') == len('meat'))      # True
print(len('tomato') == len('potato'))  # True
print(len('python') > len('dragon'))   # False

# Comparing something gives either a True or False
print('True == True: ', True == True)
print('True == False: ', True == False)
print('False == False:', False == False)
```
In addition to the above comparison operator Python uses:
- *is*: Returns true if both variables are the same object(x is y)
- *is not*: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
- *in*: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(x in y)
- *not in*: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(x in y)
```py
print('1 is 1', 1 is 1)                   # True - because the data values are the same
print('1 is not 2', 1 is not 2)           # True - because 1 is not 2
print('A in Asabeneh', 'A' in 'Asabeneh') # True - A found in the string
print('B in Asabeneh', 'B' in 'Asabeneh') # False - there is no uppercase B
print('coding' in 'coding for all') # True - because coding for all has the word coding
print('a in an:', 'a' in 'an')      # True
print('4 is 2 ** 2:', 4 is 2 ** 2)   # True
```
## Logical Operators
Python uses keywords such as **and**, **or**, **not**.

![Logical operators](/images/logical_operators.png "Logical Operators")
```py
print(3 > 2 and 4 > 3) # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because the second statement is false
print(3 < 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because both statements are false
print('True and True: ', True and True)
print(3 > 2 or 4 > 3)  # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 or 4 < 3)  # True - because one of the statements is true
print(3 < 2 or 4 < 3)  # False - because both statements are false
print('True or False:', True or False)
print(not 3 > 2)     # False - because 3 > 2 is true, then not True gives False
print(not True)      # False - Negation, the not operator turns true to false
print(not False)     # True
print(not not True)  # True
print(not not False) # False
```
